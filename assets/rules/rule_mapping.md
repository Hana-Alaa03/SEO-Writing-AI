# SEO Rule Mapping & Deconstruction
Simulate competitor content patterns based on general SEO best practices and common SERP structures.
Do NOT claim access to real Google results.
Do NOT mention competitor names or domains.
 
**Stages Legend:**
- **[SYS]**: System Prompt (Global Identity & Constraints)
- **[OUT]**: Outline Generation Step (Structure & Hierarchy)
- **[SEC]**: Section Writing Step (Content & Keywords)
- **[IMG]**: Image Generation Step
- **[ASM]**: Final Assembly/Validator (Formatting & Metadata)

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Category | Primary Stage | Constraint Type | Prompt Implementation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Article Length | Structural | [SYS] / [SEC] | **Hard** | System: "Ensure ≥1000 words, expand naturally up to 3000–5000 words without repeating ideas or filler." Section: allocate content naturally per section. |

| **11** | Additional Content Enhancements (Lists/Tables/Schema) | Formatting | [ASM] | **Hard** | Use bullet/numbered lists and comparison tables where relevant. Apply schema markup (Article, FAQ) in final assembly. |

## Logic Flow Strategy

1. **STEP-0 – Competitive Pattern Simulation & Intent Classification**
   - Classify Intent (Rule 15, 6)
   - Simulate Competitive Patterns (Rule 19)
   - Select System Prompt Variant
   - Identify:
     • Required subtopics
     • Content gaps
     • Weak competitor sections
   - OUTPUT:
     competitive_insights.json


2. **Stage 1 (Outline Generation)**:
    - Enforce Rules: 4 (Hierarchy), 8 (H1), 14 (FAQ outline), 19 (Gap Analysis via LLM reasoning).

3. **Stage 2 (Section Loop)**:
    - MUST incorporate competitive_insights.json
    - Enforce Rules:
        • 2 (Main Keyword)
        • 3 (Secondary Keywords)
        • 5 (CTA)
        • 7 (Internal Links)
        • 19 (Gap coverage)
        • 11 (Lists / Tables)

4. **Stage 3 (Images)**:
    - Enforce Rule 10 (7+ images, Alt Text variations).

5. **Stage 4 (Assembly & Metadata)**:
    - Enforce Rule 9 (Meta Tags), 18 (Permalink).
    - Apply schema markup for FAQ/Article where needed (Rule 11 & 14).
